                    I am a dedicated Bachelor of Computing in Computer Science student at the National University of Singapore (NUS), set to graduate in 2025. My academic journey, complemented by a Diploma with Merit in Applied Chemistry from Singapore Polytechnic, has equipped me with a unique blend of analytical and problem-solving skills. I am passionate about leveraging technology to solve complex problems, with a particular interest in machine learning, software engineering principles, and building robust systems.
